## Duncan's Occupational Prestige Data

#### Intro to data

We have a data set with measurements on 45 different U.S. occupations as of 1950 (descriptions from Fox and Weisberg, 2011):

 * `type`: Type of occupation. A factor with the following levels: `prof`, professional and managerial; `wc`, white-collar; `bc`, blue-collar.
 * `income`: Percentage of occupational incumbents in the 1950 US Census who earned $3,500 or more per year (about $37,500 in 2019 US dollars).
 * `education`: Percentage of occupational incumbents in 1950 who were high school graduates (this might be more like having a college degree in current times?)
 * `prestige`: Percentage of respondents in a social survey who rated the occupation as "good" or better in prestige
 
```{r}
head(Duncan, 3)
```

Let's consider a model for occupational prestige as a function of income, education, and type of occupation.

**Option 1 for Plots: plotly**

 * Formatting very similar to, but not exactly the same as, ggplot2
 * **Can't show output in pdf, only for html output or interactive use**
 * Can't be used for any more variables than we have in this example.
 * If plotly code doesn't give you what you want right away, it can be essentially impossible to fix (not a fully developed and functional package).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(Duncan, x = ~income, y = ~education, z = ~prestige, color = ~type) %>%
  add_markers()
```

Here's a screenshot, will demo live:

**Option 2 for Plots: Pairs Plots**

```{r, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(GGally) # contains the ggpairs function
# I like to plot only variables I'm interested in at the moment, with the response last
ggpairs(Duncan %>% select(type, income, education, prestige))
```

Compare the plot in the third column and fourth row to the following:

```{r, fig.width=2, fig.height = 1.5}
ggplot(data = Duncan, mapping = aes(x = education, y = prestige)) +
  geom_point()
```

Is there any evidence of outliers or influential observations?

\newpage

## A first model - income only explanatory variable

```{r}
lm_fit_1 <- lm(prestige ~ income, data = Duncan)
summary(lm_fit_1)
```

```{r, fig.height = 2}
ggplot(data = Duncan, mapping = aes(x = income, y = prestige)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

#### What is the equation of the estimated line?

\vspace{3cm}

#### What is the interpretation of the coefficient estimate for income?

\newpage

## Second Model: income and education as explanatory variables

```{r}
lm_fit_2 <- lm(prestige ~ income + education, data = Duncan)
summary(lm_fit_2)
```

#### What's the estimated equation for the mean from this model?

\vspace{3cm}

#### This can be visualized as a plane

Plotly code suppressed because it's awful.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
income_grid <- seq(from = min(Duncan$income), to = max(Duncan$income), length = 11)
education_grid <- seq(from = min(Duncan$education), to = max(Duncan$education), length = 11)
x_grid <- expand.grid(
  income = income_grid,
  education = education_grid
)
z <- predict(lm_fit_2, newdata = x_grid)
dim(z) <- c(11, 11)
z <- t(z)
plot_ly(showscale = FALSE) %>% #, color = ~type) %>%
  add_markers(data = Duncan, x = ~income, y = ~education, z = ~ prestige) %>%
  add_surface(x = ~income_grid, y = ~education_grid, z = ~ z, opacity = 0.8)
```

#### What is the interpretation of the coefficient estimate for income?

\vspace{6cm}

Here is a plot showing the estimated relationship between income and prestige, for three different values of education:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
income_grid <- seq(from = min(Duncan$income), to = max(Duncan$income), length = 11)
education_grid <- c(10, 50, 100)
x_grid <- expand.grid(
  income = income_grid,
  education = education_grid
)
x_grid$prestige <- predict(lm_fit_2, newdata = x_grid)
ggplot(data = x_grid, mapping = aes(x = income, y = prestige, color = factor(education))) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(begin = 0.15, end = 0.85, option = "B") +
  geom_line()
```

\newpage

## Third Model: All 3 explanatory variables!

```{r}
lm_fit_3 <- lm(prestige ~ income + education + type, data = Duncan)
summary(lm_fit_3)
```

Plotly code suppressed because it's awful.
